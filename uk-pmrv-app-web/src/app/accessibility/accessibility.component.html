  Accessibility Statement for the UK Emissions Trading Scheme reporting service
</app-page-heading>

<p class="govuk-body">
  This accessibility statement applies to the whole of the UK Emissions Trading Scheme reporting service.
</p>
<p class="govuk-body">
  This website is run by UK ETS Authority and UK Government regulators. We want as many people as possible to be able to
  use this website. For example, that means you should be able to:
</p>
<ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
  <li>change colours, contrast levels and fonts</li>
  <li>
    zoom in up to 400% without the text spilling off the screen and without content being truncated or overlapping
  </li>
  <li>navigate most of the website using just a keyboard</li>
  <li>navigate most of the website using speech recognition software</li>
  <li>
    listen to most of the website using a screen reader (including the most recent versions of JAWS, NVDA and VoiceOver)
  </li>
</ul>
<p class="govuk-body">We have also made the website text as simple as possible to understand.</p>
<p class="govuk-body">
  <a class="govuk-link" href="https://mcmw.abilitynet.org.uk/" rel="noreferrer noopener">AbilityNet</a> has advice on
  making your device easier to use if you have a disability.
</p>

<h3 class="govuk-heading-s">How accessible this website is</h3>
<p class="govuk-body">We know some parts of this website are not fully accessible:</p>
<ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
  <li>
    Data tables will not reflow in a single column when you change the size of the browser window. Data tables are
    exempt from the WCAG 2.1 reflow requirement, and may require some horizontal scrolling in order to view all the
    content of those tables.
  </li>
  <li>
    For some screen reader software users, black triangles may be mentioned in the sortable data table headings. These
    will not impact on how the tables can be sorted, and can be ignored.
  </li>
  <li>
    On screens that allow you to review information submitted in forms, the “Change” control comes at the start of each
    section in the reading order, rather than at the end of the section.
  </li>
  <li>
    There is inconsistent behaviour for disclosure elements between earlier versions and the current version of Dragon
    Naturally Speaking and the browser being used. Dragon Naturally Speaking does not respond to commands such as “Click
    button” or “click[keyword]” but does respond to “Press tab key” and “Press enter key”, so these commands can be used
    to operate the disclosure element.
  </li>
</ul>
