<p class="govuk-body">
  Emissions may be determined using either a calculation-based methodology or measurement-based methodology, unless use
  of a specific methodology is mandatory according to Article 21 of the Monitoring and Reporting Regulation (MRR).
</p>

<p class="govuk-body">
  The calculation approach determines emissions from source streams on the basis of activity data from measurement
  systems and additional parameters from laboratory analyses or default values. The calculation approach is then
  implemented through standard methodology under Article 24 of the MRR (for example Combustion Emissions = Fuel
  Combusted x NCV x Emission Factor) or the mass-balance methodology set out in Article 25.
</p>

<p class="govuk-body">
  You can combine calculation and measurement approaches for different sources, if the competent authority approves. You
  must ensure and demonstrate that there are no gaps or double counting of reportable emissions.
