  <p class="govuk-body">
    The monitoring plan you create for this source stream using a calculation approach will calculate the amount of CO2e
    emitted during the course of the year based on activity data alongside a number of other calculation parameters.
  </p>

  <p class="govuk-body">
    The activity data tier refers to the level of accuracy in how the amount of a fuel or material within a source
    stream category is being measured.
  </p>

  <p class="govuk-body">
    The <a govukLink routerLink=".">Monitoring and Reporting Regulations (MRR)</a>
    list the tiers which are expected for activity data based on considering criteria such as:
  </p>
  <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
    <li>your installation category - Category A (low emitter), Category A, B or C</li>
    <li>your source stream category</li>
    <li>the particular fuel or material being used</li>
    <li>the related regulated activity</li>
  </ul>

  <p class="govuk-body">
    You may not be able to meet the highest tier as required in the MRR. If this is the case you will be asked in
    another section of this permit application to justify if this is due to a technical infeasibility or unreasonable
    cost.
  </p>

  <p class="govuk-body">
    If your activity data for this source stream category is being measured by metering devices or methods which have a
    higher level of accuracy than the minimum required tier you must select a tier equal to the accuracy of this
    metering device.
