  <p class="govuk-body">
    All of the meters and methods relating to your measurement of the amount of fuel or material you are using within
    this source stream category must be accounted for.
  </p>

  <p class="govuk-body">
    E.g. Your fuel may come from a single tank and be routed to 5 different emission sources. If your meters for this
    fuel are measuring the amount of fuel used by each emission source, you must include each meter.
  </p>

  <p class="govuk-body">
    Overall uncertainty must be determined by squaring the uncertainty of each individual meter, adding the values
    together and then taking square root.
