  <p class="govuk-body">
    A calculation approach enables emissions to be monitored by measuring the amount of a fuel or material source stream
    being consumed and then calculating the resulting emissions through the use of additional parameters in a formula
  </p>

  <p class="govuk-body">
    Most installations release emissions as a result of burning a source stream fuel for heat and power and can account
    for their emissions using the following formula:
  </p>

  <p class="govuk-body">
    Total CO2e emissions = Activity data x Net calorific value x Emission factor x Oxidation factor
  </p>

  <p class="govuk-body">
    The Monitoring and Reporting Regulations (MRR) should be consulted to ensure that you are able to use the
    calculation approach for your regulated activity as well as learning which formula parameters are expected for your
    fuel or material source stream.
