= Ensuring secure passwords

== Introduction
This document focuses on the approach and decisions taken to ensure that users peak and maintain secure passwords for the use of the service. The solution used combines open source software and a freely available service to ensure that:

. the chosen password is strong enough
. not already exposed on the internet (blacklisted)

The solution itself is packaged as a service with a simple API and integrated in the overall PMRV solution as another separately deployed component.

== Password strength
In the past there has been a lot of talk around password rules and guidance such as:

* use at least one upper and one lower case letter
* use only digits, letters and the symbols !@#$%^
* do not use spaces
* etc.

Since we are following ASVS 4.0.1 it is worth remembering that all such rules are explicitly discarded under ASVS 2.1.9:

.ASVS 2.1.9
****
Verify that there are no password composition rules limiting the type of characters permitted. There should be no requirement for upper or lower case or numbers or special characters.
****

We have instead opted for *zxcvbn* algorithm, to check for password strength. Details on the specific algorithm and its benefits can be found at https://dropbox.tech/security/zxcvbn-realistic-password-strength-estimation (including a relevant paper and presentation).

In practice, following the NCSC guidance on using three random words concatenated is more than sufficient to reach the highest entry on the password strength meter. 

From a maintenance standpoint we use this algorithm on the backend (implemented in Java) and route all relevant requests from any frontend or backend actions including Keycloak actions through this same implementation.

== Blacklisting

A strong password is not worth much if that password has been used and compromised before. For this reason ASVS requires a check against a black list of passwords on top of any other measure.

.ASVS 2.1.7
****
Verify that passwords submitted during account registration, login, and password change are checked against a set of breached passwords either locally (such as the top 1,000 or 10,000 most common passwords which match the system's password policy) or using an external API. If using an API a zero knowledge proof or other mechanism should be used to ensure that the plain text password is not sent or used in verifying the breach status of the password. If the password is breached, the application must require the user to set a new non-breached password.
****

In other words for every password we need to check whether the password has been used before (by any user not necessarily the one currently trying to use it) on any breached site (anywhere on the internet and not necessarily related with UK PMRV).

Two options for implementing this blacklist feature were possible. One was to setup the relevant list in our IDM platform (a feature supported directly by the platform chosen, Keycloak) and the other was to use an external API. Since using a hardcoded file would add an occasional maintenance burden, plus it would push all the checking/matching load on our platform, an API approach was preferrable.

The option chosen was to use the ihavebeenpwned service based on guidance from NCSC (https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/blog-post/passwords-passwords-everywhere) and the fact that the specific API we plan on using is free and secure according to the recommendation of ASVS mentioned above (https://haveibeenpwned.com/API/v3#SearchingPwnedPasswordsByRange). 

Given the fact that blacklisting applies during registration, password change and more importantly login we can safely bypass the problem of an occasional temporary service unavailability with a simple warning in the logs. The rationale is that the password will be checked again next time the user logs in so it is considered safe to ignore temporary service failures.

If needed this mechanism can be enhanced by a fallback to the IDM platform's built-in hardcoded list mechanism in the future (assuming the service proves unreliable enough to warrant the expense of implementing this fallback).

== Combining the features needed and deploying the final solution

In our overall PMRV solution initial password setup, password change and login are functionalities offloaded to different components. Therefore, it was decided that the best approach to handle the needed dependencies is to create a separate component to handle password validation and have all our other components depend on this one, as can be seen in the following (focused) logical diagram.

This allows easy tinkering of the solution in the future (if for example we want to use additional checks for password strength or if we want to strengthen our blacklist checking with a secondary service for example) and easy monitoring of any problems (one component log file to check for password problems).
